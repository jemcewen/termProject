November 8th(First Sprint Complete)

James McEwen:

I worked on the following tasks:

1. Adding the update button: - This button is responsible for saving the changes made in the edit reminder page.
2. Adding the delete button - This button adds functionality to delete reminders from the database.

Additional time was spent on the following:

1. Watching the in-depth videos on how the reminder app starter code was built.
2. Watching the videos on authentication and researching passport.js
